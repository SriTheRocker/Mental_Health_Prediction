## Multi-Class Classification of Mental Health Topics


### **Project Description**  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze Reddit posts for detecting mental health concerns. It solves a **multi-class classification problem**, categorizing mental health-related text into three groups:  
1. **Disorders**  
2. **Improvements**  
3. **Distress**  

Using **Sentiment Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning models**, this study identifies patterns in mental health discussions to develop a scalable tool for mental health diagnostics.

### **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Scraped data from 45 Reddit subreddits (~100,000 posts).  
   - Categories: Disorders, Improvements, Distress.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Stop word removal, lemmatization, punctuation elimination, text normalization.  
   - Features: Word counts, sentiment scores, post metadata.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Combined linguistic and metadata features for model training.  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - Multiple models trained using TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API.  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall.  
   - Optimization: Dropout layers, early stopping, checkpointing.  

---

### **Limitations**  
- Data bias from Reddit user demographics.  
- Lack of expert-validated categorization.  
- Challenges in interpreting complex emotional expressions (e.g., sarcasm).  
- Computational resource requirements for transformer-based models.
